#Clean Slate for GetSimple CMS

*Clean Slate* is a bare bones starter theme for [GetSimple CMS](http://www.get-simple.info/ "GetSimple CMS"). It contains some minimal markup and a couple of [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki "Object Oriented CSS")-inspired classes to get you started, but that's it.

## Component Dependencies

*Clean Slate* uses components for the theme's tagline and sidebar. If you don't want/need them, just remove the <code>&lt;?php get_component('tagline'); ?&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;?php get_component('sidebar'); ?&gt;</code> located in the <code>header.inc.php</code> and <code>sidebar.inc.php</code> files.

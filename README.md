#Clean Slate for GetSimple CMS

*Clean Slate* is a bare bones starter theme for [GetSimple CMS](http://www.get-simple.info/ "GetSimple CMS"). It contains some minimal markup and a couple of [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki "Object Oriented CSS")-inspired classes to get you started, but that's it.

##Component Dependencies
*Clean Slate* uses a compontent for the site's tagline. If you don't want/need one, just remove the <code>&lt;p>&lt;?php get_component('tagline'); ?&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> located in the <code>header.inc.php</code> file.

Use it, abuse it and give me credit, if you want to.
